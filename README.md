# YuGiOh-Database
Using Python and sqlite I'm building a complete YuGiOh database, with a total of more than 11 000 Cards, Opened to everyone who want to make a fan YuGiOh game.

Get .db file and open it in your sql browser.The Python code is how I scrapped to get data needed for the database. 
The card image folder contains all images of cards.

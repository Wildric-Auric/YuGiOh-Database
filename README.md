# YuGiOh-Database
Using Python and sqlite I built a complete YuGiOh database, with a total of more than 11 000 Cards, Opened to everyone who want to make a fan YuGiOh game.

Get .db file and open it in your sql browser.The Python code is how I scrapped to get data needed for the database:

The card image folder contains all images of cards named using cards [id](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Passcode):

If you need to see see the code that filled the database, open the Python script that used mainly Requests module to get card infos, parsed by myself, from [the Fandom YuGiOh website](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Wiki_Yu-Gi-Oh!) and to get card pictures from [ygoprodeck](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/).

If you need an addition to the database (like text translation), modify the code or feel free to ask me about it.
